We are so excited about all of the sessions and topics we have planned. Our theme is Restored to Sanity and we will have a variety of sessions around the theme to help you dig deeper and learn how to apply the topics into your life.

Since we are still solidifying things, our schedule is tentative for now. You can return in a few weeks to see if we’ve added more content or you can sign up here to get updates. When you sign up you will get updates that relate only to this retreat. If you would like other SA or SAnon newsletters and updates, you’ll need to sign up for those on the SA or SAnon Utah pages separately.
