For many of us, the first time we came to a retreat it was scarier than coming to a meeting. With both SAs and SAnons there we were concerned about it being a safe place for our own stories and our own healing. Through our experience with the program we have found that the people coming to retreats are kind and considerate. Together we create a space that is very safe by following the 12 traditions that have guided and kept our organization strong and safe.

You can expect to find new discoveries about your program and greater compassion for others working their own program. You will hear more stories and connect with people who are using the program to overcome similar problems. We have also found it to be very beneficial to hear from people working the other side of the program. If we are an S-Anon, we find that we learn a lot and gain a lot of compassion when we hear SA stories. If we are an SA, we find that we gain understanding and clarity when we hear S-Anon stories. Getting together to solve our common problems brings a lot of power to our program.
